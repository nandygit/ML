A system of linear equations consists of multiple linear equations with shared variables, where each equation represents a line, plane, or higher-dimensional surface based on the number of variables.
The solution is the set of variable values that satisfy all equations, often corresponding to the points of intersection of the represented lines or planes.
Matrix Equation
These equations can be written in matrix form as AX = B, where:


A is the coefficient matrix,
X is the column vector of variables [x1, x2, x3,…., xn ]T ,
B is the column vector of constants [b1 + b2 + b3 + …. + bn ]T.

​
 

Solving the system involves finding the values of x1, x2, x3,…., xn that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

Solution of a System of Linear Equation
A system of linear equations can have three possible types of solutions:

No Solution (Inconsistent System)
Unique Solution (Consistent and Determinate System)
Infinite Solutions (Consistent and Indeterminate System)
The existence and nature of solutions depend on the properties of the coefficient matrix A and the augmented matrix [A:B].

A system of linear equations can be categorized into two types:

Homogeneous System (AX=0)
Non-Homogeneous System (AX=B)
The solution of these systems depends on the rank of the coefficient matrix A and the rank of the augmented matrix [A:B].

1) System of Homogeneous linear equations AX = 0

X = 0 is always a solution; means all the unknowns has same value as zero. (This is also called trivial solution)
If P(A) = number of unknowns : Unique solution ( P(A) = Rank of matrix A).
If P(A) < number of unknowns : Infinite number of solutions.
Since a homogeneous system always has at least one solution (X = 0), it is always consistent.

Example of Homogeneous System in three variable


x + y – z = 0
x + y + z = 0
x – y + 2z = 0


2) System of Non-Homogeneous linear equations AX = B

If P[A:B] ≠ P(A), No solution.
If P[A:B] = P(A) = Number of unknown variables, unique solution.
If P[A:B] = P(A) ≠ Number of unknown, infinite number of solutions.
Example of Non – Homogeneous System in three variable


x + y – 2z = 6
x – 6y + z = 9
2x – y + 2z = 2
