A system of linear equations consists of multiple linear equations with shared variables, where each equation represents a line, plane, or higher-dimensional surface based on the number of variables.
The solution is the set of variable values that satisfy all equations, often corresponding to the points of intersection of the represented lines or planes.
Matrix Equation
These equations can be written in matrix form as AX = B, where:


A is the coefficient matrix,
X is the column vector of variables [x1, x2, x3,…., xn ]T ,
B is the column vector of constants [b1 + b2 + b3 + …. + bn ]T.

​
 

Solving the system involves finding the values of x1, x2, x3,…., xn that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

Solution of a System of Linear Equation
A system of linear equations can have three possible types of solutions:

No Solution (Inconsistent System)
Unique Solution (Consistent and Determinate System)
Infinite Solutions (Consistent and Indeterminate System)
The existence and nature of solutions depend on the properties of the coefficient matrix A and the augmented matrix [A:B].

A system of linear equations can be categorized into two types:

Homogeneous System (AX=0)
Non-Homogeneous System (AX=B)
The solution of these systems depends on the rank of the coefficient matrix A and the rank of the augmented matrix [A:B].

1) System of Homogeneous linear equations AX = 0

X = 0 is always a solution; means all the unknowns has same value as zero. (This is also called trivial solution)
If P(A) = number of unknowns : Unique solution ( P(A) = Rank of matrix A).
If P(A) < number of unknowns : Infinite number of solutions.
Since a homogeneous system always has at least one solution (X = 0), it is always consistent.

Example of Homogeneous System in three variable


x + y – z = 0
x + y + z = 0
x – y + 2z = 0


2) System of Non-Homogeneous linear equations AX = B

If P[A:B] ≠ P(A), No solution.
If P[A:B] = P(A) = Number of unknown variables, unique solution.
If P[A:B] = P(A) ≠ Number of unknown, infinite number of solutions.
Example of Non – Homogeneous System in three variable


x + y – 2z = 6
x – 6y + z = 9
2x – y + 2z = 2


1. Statelessness
In REST, statelessness means that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any session information about the client between requests. Every request is independent, and the server does not rely on any information from previous requests.

Example: When a user logs in or performs an action, all the necessary information (like authentication tokens, session data, etc.) must be sent with each request. The server will not store any session information between requests.

2. Client-Server Architecture
The client-server model means that the client (such as a web browser or mobile app) and the server (which processes and stores data) are separate entities. They communicate over a network (such as the Internet) through standard protocols like HTTP.

Example: In a RESTful system, the client could be a mobile app requesting data, and the server handles data storage, processing, and responding to requests. The client only focuses on presenting the data to the user.

3. Uniform Interface
A uniform interface means that the API follows a standard set of conventions for interacting with resources (data). This allows clients to interact with different services in a consistent way, making APIs easier to use and integrate.

Key elements of a uniform interface include:

Standard HTTP methods: Using HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources (data).

GET retrieves data.
POST creates new data.
PUT updates existing data.
DELETE removes data.
Consistent URLs: Each resource (such as a user, product, or order) is accessed using a unique, predictable URL.
Example:

GET /users: Retrieves a list of users.
POST /users: Creates a new user.
GET /users/{id}: Retrieves a specific user by ID.
PUT /users/{id}: Updates a specific user.
DELETE /users/{id}: Deletes a specific user.
4. Cacheability
In REST, cacheability refers to the idea that responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. Caching helps improve the performance of an API by reducing the need for repeated requests for the same data, saving both time and resources.

Example: If a request to GET /products returns data that doesn't change frequently, the server can tell the client to cache the response for a specific period, reducing the need to fetch the same data again.

5. Layered System
A RESTful system can be composed of multiple layers that sit between the client and server, such as load balancers, security proxies, or caching servers. Each layer only interacts with the layer directly above or below it, and the client cannot see the layers in between.

Example: A client might interact with a gateway API that handles authentication and rate limiting before forwarding the request to a backend server that processes the data.

6. Code on Demand
Code on Demand is an optional constraint in REST. The server can provide executable code (such as JavaScript or WebAssembly) to the client, which can then be executed to extend the client’s functionality.

Example: A server might send JavaScript code to the client to update the user interface or add new behavior to the application without requiring a full page refresh.

Designing a RESTful API
When designing a RESTful API, there are several best practices to follow:

1. Use Meaningful Resource Names
Resource names should be nouns, and they should be plural if they represent a collection of items. For example:

/users for a collection of users.
/users/{id} for a specific user.
2. Consistent Use of HTTP Methods
Ensure that HTTP methods are used consistently. For instance, use GET to retrieve data, POST to create new records, PUT or PATCH to update records, and DELETE to remove records.

3. Keep URLs Simple and Intuitive
URLs should be simple, meaningful, and easy to understand. Avoid using complex query parameters or redundant path segments.

4. Provide Clear Error Responses
Ensure that your API provides clear and meaningful error messages. A typical RESTful API will return a proper HTTP status code (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) along with an error message in the response body.

5. Versioning
APIs may evolve over time, so it's important to version your API. This can be done by including the version in the URL, such as /v1/users or /api/v1/users.

Use Cases of RESTful API
RESTful APIs are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity, scalability, and flexibility. Below are some common use cases for RESTful APIs:

Social Media Applications: A mobile app or web application can use a RESTful API to fetch posts, likes, comments, and user profiles. The mobile app interacts with the backend server through RESTful APIs to send and receive data in real-time.
E-Commerce Platforms: In an e-commerce application, RESTful APIs are used to manage customer orders, payment processing, and inventory. The API handles data from the front-end (the customer-facing interface) and interacts with back-end services, such as databases and payment gateways.
Banking and Financial Services: In the banking industry, RESTful APIs are used for operations like transaction management, account querying, and customer service. They allow for secure, reliable communication between clients (such as mobile banking apps) and servers, while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
IoT (Internet of Things) Applications: RESTful APIs are ideal for managing communication between devices in IoT systems. They allow devices like sensors, smart home appliances, and wearables to send data to a server, and also enable interaction with these devices remotely.
Conclusion
A RESTful API is not just about using HTTP methods; it’s about applying the fundamental REST principles to create APIs that are intuitive, flexible, and scalable. By sticking to these principles, developers can build APIs that are both easy to use and easy to evolve over time.
